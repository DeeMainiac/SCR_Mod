# Features

Adds several species of SCPs to wander the Rim; either neutral or outright hostile to pawn life.

Adds anomalous weapons and apparel that add all sorts of effects. From a pistol that turns headshots into meals to a submachine gun that's alive and shoots teeth, you'll be surprised what you'll find in the hands of raiders or deep in ancient ruins.

Adds special 'containment procedures' for all anomalous entities that can appear. From simple powered shelves that keep an object from degrading to specialized walls and security doodads to lock up the nastiest the Rim has to offer. Don't forget: If it has a will of it's own, it will probably try to escape!

Adds event(s) and factions so your storyteller keeps you on your toes. From [SCP-3199](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3199) attacks to Chaos Insurgency [SCP-3033](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3033) raids, you'll see the weaponized forms of SCPs you'll be tempted to enact on others too.

Also adds non-anomalous gear and apparel to help capture SCPs and keep those D-Class in their place.


Pay attention to an object's classifications to ensure the safety of your colonists. Or don't. There are three classifications: Containment class, Disruption class, and Risk class. They help indicate what effects the SCP has at a glance, and each one is listed in an object's information menu. A Safe, Dark, Notice-classed SCP doesn't mean it isn't dangerous.

Some of the classifications may have been adjusted thanks to the Rim being quite different than the Foundation's normal stomping grounds (or are completely made up because they don't have vanilla/canon Disruption/Risk classes). 
While knowing the SCP's entry can help in some cases, it isn't essential to play this mod.
